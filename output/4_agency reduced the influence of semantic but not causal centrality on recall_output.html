See manuscript results section: Agency reduced the influence of semantic but not causal centrality on recall
------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Observed significant differences across conditions, wherein Free had lower semantic influence on memory compared to Yoked and Passive.

Adventure — Semantic
  Free:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.223, t(21)=5.582, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.230, z(21)=5.483, p=0.000
  Yoked:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.323, t(44)=16.071, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.329, z(44)=15.031, p=0.000
  Passive:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.308, t(48)=12.681, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.317, z(48)=11.968, p=0.000
  ANOVA (Semantic):   F(2,113) = 3.04, p = 0.052

Romance — Semantic
  Free:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.146, t(17)=6.109, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.148, z(17)=6.062, p=0.000
  Yoked:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.221, t(52)=19.021, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.223, z(52)=18.431, p=0.000
  Passive:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.265, t(54)=20.003, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.268, z(54)=19.035, p=0.000
  ANOVA (Semantic):   F(2,123) = 11.46, p = 0.000


4.2 Causal influence on memory did not differ across agency conditions.

Adventure — Causal
  Free:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.187, t(21)=4.604, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.191, z(21)=4.554, p=0.000
  Yoked:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.159, t(44)=5.453, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.165, z(44)=5.381, p=0.000
  Passive:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.126, t(48)=4.922, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.131, z(48)=4.854, p=0.000
  ANOVA (Causal):     F(2,113) = 0.86, p = 0.424

Romance — Causal
  Free:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.213, t(17)=8.613, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.216, z(17)=8.169, p=0.000
  Yoked:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.236, t(52)=14.398, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.239, z(52)=13.866, p=0.000
  Passive:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.244, t(54)=23.988, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.246, z(54)=23.059, p=0.000
  ANOVA (Causal):     F(2,123) = 0.64, p = 0.530


4.3 Two-way ANOVA (Network Type × Condition) on centrality effects.

There was a significant network type × agency interaction for the Adventure story and a trend for the same for the Romance story.

Adventure — Two-way ANOVA (Condition × Network):
  Condition: F(2,113) = 0.53, p = 0.592
  Network: F(1,113) = 47.78, p = 0.000
  Condition × Network: F(2,113) = 3.27, p = 0.042

Romance — Two-way ANOVA (Condition × Network):
  Condition: F(2,123) = 2.78, p = 0.066
  Network: F(1,123) = 0.29, p = 0.592
  Condition × Network: F(2,123) = 2.99, p = 0.054
