See manuscript results section: Agency magnified individual variability in recall and choice
------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.1 Individual variability in recalled events. Recall ISC was significantly above zero in all three conditions.

Romance: Free   
  Raw stats:         r=0.136, t(152)=11.743, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform:  r=0.139, z=11.670, p=0.000
Romance: Yoked  
  Raw stats:         r=0.226, t(1377)=58.278, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform:  r=0.231, z=55.817, p=0.000
Romance: Passive
  Raw stats:         r=0.249, t(1484)=70.862, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform:  r=0.254, z=67.249, p=0.000

2.1.2 Agency induced greater individual variability in which events were recalled.

ANOVA: F(2,3013) = 48.13, p = 0.000
  Free vs Passive: t(1636)=-9.73, p=0.000
  Free vs Yoked: t(1529)=-7.28, p=0.000
  Yoked vs Passive: t(2861)=-4.46, p=0.000
  Bonferroni-corrected pairwise tests:
    Free vs Passive: p_bonf=0.000, Free vs Yoked: p_bonf=0.000, Yoked vs Passive: p_bonf=0.000

2.1.3 Excluding choice events, the pattern remained: Recall ISC was above zero in all conditions.

Romance: Free   
  Raw stats:         r=0.157, t(152)=13.210, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform:  r=0.160, z=13.076, p=0.000
Romance: Yoked  
  Raw stats:         r=0.219, t(1377)=51.430, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform:  r=0.225, z=49.031, p=0.000
Romance: Passive
  Raw stats:         r=0.229, t(1484)=59.031, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform:  r=0.235, z=55.882, p=0.000

ANOVA excluding choice events: F(2,3013) = 15.44, p = 0.000
  Free vs Passive: t(1636)=-5.68, p=0.000
  Free vs Yoked: t(1529)=-4.63, p=0.000
  Yoked vs Passive: t(2861)=-1.74, p=0.082
  Bonferroni-corrected pairwise tests (excluding choice events): Free vs Passive: p_bonf=0.000, Free vs Yoked: p_bonf=0.000, Yoked vs Passive: p_bonf=0.247

2.2.1 Choice ISC was significantly above zero in both Free and Yoked conditions.

Romance: Free  (Choice ISC)
  Raw stats:         r=0.208, t(152)=9.544, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform:  r=0.229, z=9.130, p=0.000
Romance: Yoked (Choice ISC)
  Raw stats:         r=0.255, t(1377)=36.193, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform:  r=0.288, z=24.788, p=0.000

2.2.2 Agency (full vs partial) induced greater individual variability in which options were selected.

Two-sample t-test comparing Free vs Yoked choice ISC: t(1529)=-2.11, p=0.035

2.3 Memory divergence and choice divergence were correlated with each other.

Divergence corr (corr_free18):
  Raw stats: r(16)=0.405, t(16)=1.774, p=0.095
Divergence corr (corr_free100):
  Raw stats: r(98)=0.296, t(98)=3.066, p=0.003
