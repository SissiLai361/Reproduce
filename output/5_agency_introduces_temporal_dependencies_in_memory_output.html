5.1.1 The neighbor encoding effect was positive in all three conditions for both stories.

Adventure
  Free:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.282, t(21)=6.103, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.300, z(21)=5.625, p=0.000
  Yoked:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.235, t(44)=6.193, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.253, z(44)=6.030, p=0.000
  Passive:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.239, t(48)=8.714, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.249, z(48)=8.421, p=0.000

Romance
  Free:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.352, t(17)=7.589, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.365, z(17)=7.216, p=0.000
  Yoked:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.186, t(52)=7.409, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.195, z(52)=7.095, p=0.000
  Passive:
    Raw stats:        mean=0.126, t(54)=6.426, p=0.000
    Fisher Transform: mean_z=0.129, z(54)=6.306, p=0.000

5.1.2 The neighbor encoding effect was positive in all three conditions and significantly different across conditions in the Romance story, with Free > Yoked and Free > Passive.

Romance ANOVA: F(2,123)=12.07, p=0.000
Post-hoc (pooled t-tests, equal variances):
  Free vs Yoked: t(69)=3.25, p=0.002
  Free vs Passive: t(71)=5.24, p=0.000
  Bonferroni (pooled p): Free vs Yoked: p_bonf=0.004, Free vs Passive: p_bonf=0.000

5.2 There was no significant difference in temporal violation rate across conditions in either story.

Adventure: F(2,113)=2.56, p=0.081
Romance: F(2,123)=0.10, p=0.908
