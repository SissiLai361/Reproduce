See manuscript results section: Greater memory divergence was associated with weaker semantic influence
------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 Memory divergence was negatively correlated with semantic influence in Free participants.

Romance (n≈18):
  Raw stats:        r(16)=-0.519, t=-2.430, p=0.027
  Fisher Transform: r(16)=-0.519, z=-2.228, p=0.026

Romance (n≈100):
  Raw stats:        r(98)=-0.460, t=-5.132, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform: r(98)=-0.460, z=-4.901, p=0.000

6.2 Neighbor encoding effect was positively associated with memory divergence in Free participants.

Romance (n≈18):
  Raw stats:        r(16)=0.496, t=2.283, p=0.036
  Fisher Transform: r(16)=0.496, z=2.105, p=0.035

Romance (n≈100):
  Raw stats:        r(98)=0.304, t=3.157, p=0.002
  Fisher Transform: r(98)=0.304, z=3.090, p=0.002

6.3 Neighbor encoding effect was negatively correlated with semantic influence in Free participants (both stories).

Adventure (Free):
  Raw stats:        r(20)=-0.348, t=-1.659, p=0.113
  Fisher Transform: r(20)=-0.348, z=-1.582, p=0.114

Romance (n≈18):
  Raw stats:        r(16)=-0.324, t=-1.371, p=0.189
  Fisher Transform: r(16)=-0.324, z=-1.303, p=0.193

Romance (n≈100):
  Raw stats:        r(98)=-0.347, t=-3.664, p=0.000
  Fisher Transform: r(98)=-0.347, z=-3.567, p=0.000

6.4 When including both semantic influence and the neighbor encoding scores in a multiple linear regression predicting memory divergence, semantic influence score was a significant predictor while the neighbor encoding effect only showed a trend.

Romance (n≈18):  R^2=0.389;  sem-ef p=0.080; nghb-ef p=0.107
Romance (n≈100): R^2=0.235; sem-ef p=0.000; nghb-ef p=0.087
