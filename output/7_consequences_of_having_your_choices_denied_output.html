--------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.1 Having one’s agency denied can have unique memory effects at local choice events: one’s memory for the denied choice events is selectively reduced compared to its choice-granted counterparts in the Free condition.

Adventure — Denied choice events (Yoked vs Free counterparts)
  Yoked denied:  n=45, mean=0.344, sd=0.248
  Free denied:   n=45, mean=0.485, sd=0.287
  t(88) = -2.494, p = 0.015

Romance — Denied choice events (Yoked vs Free counterparts)
  Yoked denied:  n=53, mean=0.278, sd=0.195
  Free denied:   n=53, mean=0.381, sd=0.236
  t(104) = -2.437, p = 0.017

7.2.1 The percentage of choices granted to Yoked participants did not correlate with semantic or neighbor encoding effects on memory across the two stories.

Adventure
  %Granted vs semantic effect (sem-ef):  r(43) = 0.030, p = 0.846
  %Granted vs neighbor effect (nghb-ef): r(43) = 0.128, p = 0.403

Romance
  %Granted vs semantic effect (sem-ef):  r(51) = -0.001, p = 0.994
  %Granted vs neighbor effect (nghb-ef): r(51) = -0.127, p = 0.364

7.2.2 Higher percentage of choices granted predicted greater individual tendency to forget the choice-denied events.

Adventure: r(42) = 0.335, p = 0.026

Romance: r(49) = 0.137, p = 0.336
